# docker_container_example
This tutorial is designed to help you get started with Docker, and show you how you can utilize a container to run a simple python script.  
I have added as many comments to the code files as possible, explaining each step of the process.


## Alternate Non-UI Based Example
This alternate example is based only in the shell. It can be found [here](https://github.com/VishwasSomasekhariah/Docker_container_hands_on).
